# Arabic Text Summarization 

- This project includes my work on Arabic Text Summarization Project.

- Text Summarization based on DeepLearning seq2seq models using LSTM (without attention)

- Dataset is collected by scrapping Sports new site [Kooora.com](https://www.kooora.com/).

- Data collected falls within Sports category, so it may not generalize well to other domains
- Data consists of around 35k atricles using atrilce body as text and article title as Summary label

- I used the following tools:
    - python 3.8
    - selenium : used for web scrapping
    - Flask : to build the wep application
    - tensorflow & keras : for training seq2seq model
    - Heroku : used for deployment
